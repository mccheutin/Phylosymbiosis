Keys to study the coral reef fish microbiomes

More than 600 fishes have been sampled in different corals reefs in Indian Ocean and Carribean Sea. This repository is composed of all R scripts and protocols needed from sampling part until data process for the NGS microbial sequences.
This provide a strong methodology both for molecular biology managment, bioinformatics and ecological statistics.
