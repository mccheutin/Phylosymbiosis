Keys to study the coral reef fish bacteriome structuration

About 400 fishes have been sampled in different corals reefs in Indian Ocean and Carribean Sea. This repository is composed of all R scripts needed for the data process of the NGS microbial sequences. We used 515FY - 926R universal primers (Parada et al., 2016) for the PCR amplification.
